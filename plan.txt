Getting raw audio for songs:
	-Scrape song names from Billboard 100
	-Use youtube-dl to get audio files

To generate starting times:
	-Similar process to fetching audio files, except search explicitly for "music video"
	-Limit sample window to find when the song begins (incrementally advance window bounds)
	-Try and match sparse map (spectogram peaks) with audio file sparse map
	-Store result in remote DB

Plugin:
	-Check url - if youtube, then check the video ID
	-If data for this ID is present in remote DB, set current video time
	-Done!
